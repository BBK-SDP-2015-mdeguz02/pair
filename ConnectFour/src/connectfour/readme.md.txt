Submission notes

This is Michael De Guzman's and Mike Jones' coursework 2 assignment
for SDP 2015.


We started with an imperative/Java-like approach to solving the problem,
but then wanted to see if we could implement the project by using some of the
Scala functionality that we have been learning about in class.
